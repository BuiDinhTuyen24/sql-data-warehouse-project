# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

## 📌 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Data Warehouse (DWH)** and performing analytical queries to transform raw data into meaningful business insights.  

The goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of:
- Data ingestion  
- Data transformation (ETL)  
- Data modeling (Star Schema)  
- Analytical querying  

---

## 🎯 2. Objectives
- Design a scalable **data warehouse architecture**
- Clean and transform raw data into structured formats  
- Build **fact and dimension tables**  
- Enable efficient querying for business analysis  
- Generate insights from processed data

## 🏗️ 4. Data Warehouse Architecture
The project follows a **multi-layer architecture**:

### 🔹 Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- Stores raw data as-is from source systems  
- No transformation applied  
- Used for traceability  

### 🔹 Silver Layer (Cleaned Data)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Standardizing formats  

### 🔹 Gold Layer (Business Data)
- Optimized for analytics  
- Contains **fact and dimension tables**  
- Ready for BI tools  

---

## 🔄 5. ETL Process

### Extract
- Load raw datasets into the Bronze layer  

### Transform
- Clean and normalize data  
- Remove duplicates  
- Create relationships between tables  

### Load
- Store processed data into Silver and Gold layers  

---

## 🧱 6. Data Modeling
The warehouse is designed using a **Star Schema**:

### Fact Table
- Stores measurable business metrics (e.g., sales, transactions)

### Dimension Tables
- Provide descriptive context (e.g., customers, products, time)

Benefits:
- Faster query performance  
- Better data organization  
- Easier analysis  

---

## 🔍 7. Analytical Queries
Example analyses include:
- Total revenue over time  
- Customer segmentation  
- Product performance  
- Trend analysis  

These queries are optimized for:
- Fast execution  
- Business insight generation  

---

## 📈 8. Key Insights (Example)
- Revenue trends across different time periods  
- Top-performing products/categories  
- Customer purchasing behavior patterns  

---

## 🛠️ 9. Tools & Technologies
- SQL (data processing & querying)  
- Relational Database (SQL Server / PostgreSQL)  
- Data Warehouse concepts (ETL, Star Schema)  

---

## 🚀 10. Future Improvements
- Integrate with Power BI / Tableau for visualization  
- Automate ETL pipeline  
- Use larger real-world datasets  
- Deploy to cloud platforms (Azure / AWS / GCP)  

---

## 📎 11. How to Run the Project
1. Import datasets into your database  
2. Run ETL scripts in order:
   - Bronze → Silver → Gold  
3. Execute analytical queries  
4. (Optional) Connect to BI tools for visualization  

---

## 💡 12. Key Takeaways
- Built a complete data pipeline from raw data to insights  
- Applied real-world data warehousing techniques  
- Demonstrated strong SQL and data modeling skills  


## About Me

Hi! My name is Bui Dinh Tuyen. I'm a student with a strong interest in **Data Analytics, Data Science, and Data Engineering**.  
I enjoy working with data to design efficient data models, build data pipelines, and generate insights through analytical queries.

This repository documents my journey in learning and applying **data warehousing concepts**, including data modeling, ETL processes, and analytical data structures. Through these projects, I aim to strengthen my technical skills and build practical experience in working with real-world data systems.
